## Overview

This repository is aimed at documenting my learning journey in the field of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), emphasizing GitOps practices and the usage of [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/). GitOps involves using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications, facilitating automated deployment and orchestration. The repository includes code samples, tutorials, and hands-on projects to deepen my understanding of the mentioned technologies. The goal is to develop proficiency in managing infrastructure, automating deployments, optimizing system reliability, and embracing GitOps principles.
