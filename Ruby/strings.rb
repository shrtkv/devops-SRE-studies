# Ruby also provides methods from the string class to manipulate strings. These methods can be called using the . (dot) operator after string. A few of these methods are length, reverse, upcase, and downcase.

string = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

puts string.length
puts string.reverse
puts string.downcase
puts string.upcase
